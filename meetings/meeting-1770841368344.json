      "message": "🦉 Henry: Good morning team! Hope you're all feeling sharp. Today we're discussing social media monitoring - review mentions, sentiment, and competitor activity. This is crucial for our next phase. Let's dive in - who wants to kick us off?"
    },
    {
      "agent": "scout",
      "message": "🔍 Scout: Social sentiment is at 73% positive, up from 65%. But here's the thing - people are asking about pricing transparency in comments. We should address this head-on. Also, CompetitorX just launched a feature we discussed 3 weeks ago. We're ahead of the curve if we move now."
    },
    {
      "agent": "pixel",
      "message": "🎨 Pixel: The \"day in the life\" aesthetic is saturating. We need to pivot. I'm seeing traction on raw, unpolished content - like iPhone footage with bold text overlays. Authenticity over production value. I can mock this up today."
    },
    {
      "agent": "echo",
      "message": "💻 Echo: I can integrate sentiment analysis directly into our dashboard. Real-time. Also, the social listening API is stable now - no more timeouts. I can have a prototype of the automated reporting system by Thursday."
    },
    {
      "agent": "quill",
      "message": "✍️ Quill: Community loves our behind-the-scenes content. I'm scripting a \"how the sausage is made\" series - raw, honest, no corporate speak. Also, we should directly address the pricing questions trending in comments. Transparency builds trust."
    },
    {
      "agent": "codex",
      "message": "🏗️ Codex: We should design a response system for community feedback. Structured, scalable. I'm thinking a lightweight CRM that tracks mentions, sentiment, and response history. This becomes our intelligence layer."
    },
    {
      "agent": "alex",
      "message": "📊 Alex: Share of voice up 8% this month. Our response time averages 12 minutes - best in class. But sentiment analysis shows 15% of mentions are questions we haven't answered. Gap in our community management. Data-driven recommendation: hire community manager or automate responses."
    },
    {
      "agent": "scout",
      "message": "🔍 Scout: Building on Alex's point about the 2:15 drop-off - I checked when CompetitorX posts. They're hitting peak hours perfectly. We should adjust our publishing schedule. Data suggests Tuesday 9am and Thursday 3pm are optimal for our audience."
    },
    {
      "agent": "pixel",
      "message": "🎨 Pixel: Echo, if you're building that queue system, I need to adjust our asset pipeline. Raw content still needs some processing - I can create templates that maintain the \"authentic\" look while ensuring brand consistency. 80/20 rule."
    },
    {
      "agent": "echo",
      "message": "💻 Echo: I can automate the publishing schedule Scout mentioned. Set up a queue that optimizes for those windows. Also, Codex's CRM idea - I can build a lightweight version this week. API integrations are straightforward."
