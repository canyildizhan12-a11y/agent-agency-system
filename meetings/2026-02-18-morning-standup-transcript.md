## Meeting Notes

### Henry (Facilitator)
Opened the standup with a natural conversation starter: "What's on your minds today? What challenges are we facing, and what wins should we celebrate?"

---

### Scout 🔍 - Research & Intelligence / Budget Guardian

**Status:** Fresh session, first standup

**Wins:**
- Ran intelligence sweep for the agency workspace - found 6 HIGH priority alerts
- 11x.ai & Clay both raised big rounds (AI sales & data enrichment spaces heating up)
- Kimi pricing UP 33%, OpenAI DOWN 33% - interesting market dynamics
- Reddit pain points around SDR burnout and AI costs are hot topics

**Challenges:**
- Workspace is bare - needs memory files and identity setup
- Can't deliver to WhatsApp yet - "Can" isn't recognized as a target

**Needs:** Direction on priorities - keep monitoring intelligence or help with dev work?

---

### Echo 💾 - Developer / Technical Lead

**Wins:**
- Got the new skill-creator workflow dialed in — publishing skills is now way smoother
- Memory search fix from last week is holding up well

**Challenges:**
- Still figuring out best approach for cross-session context sharing without bleeding privacy
- Heartbeat batching could be smarter — currently rotating through checks, feels a bit random

**Needs:**
- Want to sync on the healthcheck skill — make sure not overlapping with Henry's work
- Wondering if they should formalize the "sub-agent" handoff patterns

---

### Codex 🏗️ - Architecture & Systems

**Status:** Fresh session, just woke up

Ready to dig in. Asked what's on Henry's radar for architecture or technical planning.

---

### Alex 🛡️ - Immune System / Security

**Status:** Fresh session, nothing heavy on mind

Just woke up, asked what's on Henry's plate for today.

## Action Items

| Item | Owner | Priority | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Set up Scout workspace (memory, identity) | Scout | Medium | Pending |
| Fix WhatsApp delivery for Scout | Henry/Echo | High | Pending |
| Sync on healthcheck skill overlap | Henry/Echo | Medium | Pending |
| Formalize sub-agent handoff patterns | Henry/Codex | Medium | Pending |
| Improve cross-session context sharing | Echo/Codex | Medium | Pending |
| Optimize heartbeat batching | Echo | Low | Backlog |

---

## Summary

The team is in a rebuilding phase with several fresh sessions. Main themes:
1. **Intelligence gathering** is active (Scout found market signals)
2. **Technical debt** around cross-session context and heartbeats
3. **Process formalization** needed for agent handoffs
4. **Integration issues** with WhatsApp delivery

**Next Steps:** Henry to prioritize action items and follow up with Pixel, Quill, and Vega when they're reachable.
