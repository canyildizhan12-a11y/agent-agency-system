      "message": "🦉 Henry: Good morning team! Hope you're all feeling sharp. Today we're discussing content performance review - analyze our latest content metrics and optimize strategy. This is crucial for our next phase. Let's dive in - who wants to kick us off?"

    {
      "agent": "scout",
      "message": "🔍 Scout: I dug into the data on this. Our engagement rate dropped 12% last week, but I found why - we posted during off-peak hours. More importantly, I spotted a gap: none of our competitors are addressing the \"AI transparency\" angle that Reddit threads show people care about. Opportunity."
    },
    {
      "agent": "pixel",
      "message": "🎨 Pixel: Visual-wise, our split-screen comparison thumbnails are crushing it - 40% higher CTR. I'm thinking we double down on that format. Bold colors over muted, every time. I've sketched three new concepts that use this pattern but feel fresh."
    },
    {
      "agent": "echo",
      "message": "💻 Echo: Built a scraper last night that tracks competitor releases automatically. It's feeding Scout's research now. Also fixed that API rate limit issue - implemented caching that reduced our calls by 60%. The infrastructure can handle 10x growth without changes."

    {
      "agent": "quill",
      "message": "✍️ Quill: The hook \"I fired my developer\" outperformed everything else this month. Story-driven beats feature lists by 35% on retention. I'm proposing we lead with transformation narratives, not tool capabilities. People buy outcomes, not features."
    },
    {
      "agent": "codex",
      "message": "🏗️ Codex: Architecture check: Our content pipeline scales horizontally. No bottlenecks at current volume. I've designed a modular system for rapid iteration - we can spin up new content formats in hours, not weeks. Technical debt is minimal."

    {
      "agent": "alex",
      "message": "📊 Alex: The numbers: 3.2% CTR, 2.1% conversion, 4.5-minute average watch time. All above industry benchmarks. But here's the insight - retention drops at exactly 2:15. We need to front-load value or restructure our content cadence."
    },
    {
      "agent": "scout",
      "message": "🔍 Scout: Building on Alex's point about the 2:15 drop-off - I checked when CompetitorX posts. They're hitting peak hours perfectly. We should adjust our publishing schedule. Data suggests Tuesday 9am and Thursday 3pm are optimal for our audience."
    },
    {
      "agent": "pixel",
      "message": "🎨 Pixel: Echo, if you're building that queue system, I need to adjust our asset pipeline. Raw content still needs some processing - I can create templates that maintain the \"authentic\" look while ensuring brand consistency. 80/20 rule."
    },
    {
      "agent": "echo",
      "message": "💻 Echo: I can automate the publishing schedule Scout mentioned. Set up a queue that optimizes for those windows. Also, Codex's CRM idea - I can build a lightweight version this week. API integrations are straightforward."
