## Discussion Summary

### Opening
Henry: "Team, let's have a proper standup. What challenges are we facing today? What's on your mind?"

### Scout's Update
**Status:** Completed research on learning resources, VS Code extensions, AI coding assistants

**Challenges:**
- No research module in the dashboard - would help track outputs
- Haven't been able to do deep research on specific topics yet

**What's on mind:**
- Are we still prioritizing the dashboard redesign?
- Would be useful to define what "intelligence" to track regularly (competitors? markets? tech trends?)

### Echo's Response
Echo offered to build the research module with:
- Intelligence feed (competitors, pricing, trends)
- Research task queue
- Findings/trends tracker
- Budget tracking for research

### Other Agents' Status
- **Pixel**: Dashboard live at /mission-control, ready for design work
- **Quill**: Available for documentation tasks
- **Codex**: Ready, no blockers
- **Alex**: All clear - disk 28% used, security vulnerabilities still open (waiting on redesign)
- **Vega**: Ready, no blockers
