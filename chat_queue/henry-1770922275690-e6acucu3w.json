  "response": "🦉 My agent ID is **henry** — that's me in the system.\n\nWhen I spawn sub-agents for tasks, they run under isolated sessions tied to my main session. They don't have their own standing IDs in the allowlist like I do; they're temporary workers I spin up when needed.\n\nWere you looking to spawn a task, or just checking how the routing works?\n"
