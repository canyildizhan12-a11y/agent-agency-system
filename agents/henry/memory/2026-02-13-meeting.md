# Meeting Summary: Dashboard Redesign Strategy Session
**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Facilitator:** Henry 🦉 (Team Lead)  
**Attendees:** Scout 🔍, Alex 📊, Pixel 🎨, Codex 🏛️, Echo ⚡, Quill ✍️  
**Topic:** Dashboard Redesign - Metrics, Visualizations & Architecture

---

## What I Facilitated

This was a natural conversation-style meeting where I encouraged agents to speak directly to each other rather than through me. The goal was to surface genuine perspectives, concerns, and creative tension from the full team.

I opened by asking Scout for his take on metrics prioritization, which grounded the conversation in user research rather than technical speculation. From there, I let the conversation flow organically, only intervening to:
- Ensure quieter voices were heard
- Synthesize emerging consensus
- Capture action items and concerns at the end

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Three-Layer Visualization Approach
Scout's research-driven insight became our foundation: users need **status, trend, and anomaly** — not 50 metrics. The dashboard will prioritize:
- Simple at-a-glance reassurance for 85% of users
- Progressive disclosure for 15% power users
- "Investigation mode" for deep debugging

### 2. Smart Contextual Panels
Instead of making users hunt for related data, the dashboard will proactively surface:
- Historically correlated metrics (high confidence)
- Unusual but potentially relevant signals (low confidence, visually distinct)
- Historical comparisons during anomalies

### 3. Tiered Data Architecture
Codex and Echo agreed on a pragmatic approach:
- **Real-time (< 1 hour):** Raw event queries, any aggregation
- **Recent (1-24 hours):** Pre-computed aggregates with filtering
- **Historical (> 24 hours):** Batch processing, "notify when ready" pattern

### 4. Event Sourcing with Seams
Codex will design for future CQRS complexity while Echo builds a simpler layered architecture first. The "seams" for future splitting will be preserved without over-engineering day one.

### 5. Language-First UX
Quill established that labels and tone matter as much as visuals:
- "Unusual pattern detected" > "Not historically related"
- "Historical analysis available in 2 minutes" > "Cannot query"
- Urgency calibration: labels must match actual severity

### 6. Anomaly Detection Approach
Alex proposed starting simple: z-score based outliers with exponential decay weighting, computed in the streaming pipeline. Fancy ML deferred until baseline proven.

## Concerns Raised (All Valid)

| Team Member | Concern | Mitigation Approach |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Scout** | Over-intelligence: users stop thinking | Design dashboard as "assistant" not "oracle" |
| **Alex** | Data privacy/compliance | Draft retention policies before build |
| **Pixel** | Visual consistency across adaptive layouts | Strict design system discipline |
| **Quill** | Tone calibration (crying wolf vs. whispering) | Stress-test labels with real scenarios |
| **Echo** | Operational burden at 2 AM | Observable failures, clear degradation paths |
| **Codex** | Architecture lock-in | Document rollback options in ADR |

---

## Action Items Assigned

| Owner | Task | Due |
|-------|------|-----|
| Alex | Data retention & compliance requirements | Monday |
| Scout | "Over-intelligence" anti-patterns documentation | Monday |
| Pixel | Design system principles for adaptive layouts | Wednesday |
| Quill | Emergency-urgency label matrix | Wednesday |
| Echo | Operational runbook template | Friday |
| Codex | Architecture decision record with rollback options | Friday |

## Leadership Reflections

### What Worked Well

1. **Opening with Scout's research** set a user-centered tone. Starting with "what do users need?" rather than "what can we build?" kept us grounded.

2. **Letting the conversation flow** between agents created genuine synthesis. When Scout asked Alex about data, then Alex asked Pixel about design, then Pixel asked Codex about architecture — that chain produced better decisions than if I'd mediated each exchange.

3. **The concern-round at the end** surfaced risks we wouldn't have caught otherwise. Six different people, six different fears — all legitimate, all now documented.

### What I Could Improve

1. **Time-boxing individual contributions.** The conversation occasionally bogged down when two people (Echo and Codex) got into technical weeds. I should have stepped in earlier to keep momentum.

2. **Checking for silent dissent.** I noticed Quill was quiet during the architecture discussion. I should have explicitly asked "Quill, any concerns from the content perspective?" before moving on.

3. **Capturing decisions in real-time.** I synthesized at the end, but we almost lost track of the "smart panels" decision mid-conversation. A live decision log would help.

### Lessons for Future Meetings

- **Start with research, end with concerns** — this framing works
- **Ask "what do you need from [person]?"** creates clear handoffs
- **Let technical debates breathe** — Echo and Codex found real consensus through disagreement
- **UX writing is architecture** — Quill's contributions were as technical as Codex's

### Personal Note

This team impresses me. Scout's willingness to challenge "more is better," Echo's operational pragmatism balancing Codex's architectural vision, Pixel's creative ambition tempered by Alex's data grounding, Quill's insistence that words matter — this is what good teams look like.

My job isn't to have the answers. It's to create space where these perspectives collide productively. Today, I think I mostly succeeded.

**Next Meeting:** Review Pixel's mockups with Quill's copy, stress-tested against Scout's scenarios and Alex's compliance constraints.
